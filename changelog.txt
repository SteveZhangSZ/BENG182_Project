When recording the nucleotides, the code assumes that in the reverse complement sequence, the nucleotide
having an index of one is the leftmost, like the original sequence.

If there are multiple strands with the same end position, only the longest one ending at that position 
will be recorded

Any reading frame on the forward strand is marked with '+' and 
any on the reverse strand is marked with '-'

The stop codon isn't recorded in the sequence.

The start index refers to the 'T' in "CAT", the reverse complement of "ATG". The end index refers to the
first stop codon letter the sequence ends on.
